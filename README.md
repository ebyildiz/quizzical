# Hello!

I made this project following Scrimba's figma design, but the implementation 100% belongs to me. I made this project after my first intro to React course. I used Javascript.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies and run the project in watch mode
```
npm install
npm run build # or watch to rebuild on change
open index.html
```
